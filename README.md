# git_test
My first GitHub repo!
Hello Odin!
This is my next edit. I want to see it's modified state.
Adding some text. And again, this is just to see if I can stage and commit by myself.
One more time just for good measure.
Gotta try out VIM
Had a weird VIM error message.
Fuck VIM bro. That shit is whacked. Just always use git commit -m "your text".
Alright got VIM workflow in the bag. I'm good. Prefer the git commit -m method though.
